(ns kmet.app.tools.eval
  "The `eval` tool: model-written Clojure in the agent session's persistent
   SCI environment (`kmet.app.eval`). Unlike `codemode`, the environment is
   kept across calls, so a definition from one call is visible to the next.
   The tool declares no execution mode: the loop examines each call's code
   before executing a batch, and a batch containing a verb definition runs in
   source order, so that visibility never depends on which future wins the
   session's call lock. Every successful definition is written to the agent
   home's eval library — the session cwd's scope by default, the global scope
   when requested — and loaded by every session; a new session or a restart
   sees both layers. The
   fresh-context, output-economy tool stays `codemode`.

   The shared `read`, `write`, `edit` and `bash` verbs (also
   available as `core/...`) are the file and shell surface. The sandbox has no
   `tools` namespace: an eval call cannot invoke any tool."
